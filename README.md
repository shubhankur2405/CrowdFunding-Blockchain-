# Building a Crowd Funded BlockChain Lottery Application

Among the various applications of BlockChain, optimizing lottery is one of the urgent needs to ensure their fairness and transparency. The emerging blockchain technology shows a glimpse of solutions to fairness and transparency issues faced by lottery industries. Here we present the design of a blockchain-based lottery system. We adopt the smart contracts of blockchain technology and the cryptograph blockchain model. Fairness, transparency, and privacy of the proposed blockchain-based lottery system is shown.
